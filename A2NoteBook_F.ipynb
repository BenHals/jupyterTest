Since the rate of overall insertions/deletions is dependant of the length of the sequence (each site has a chance to add an insertion or deletion, so more sites = more I/D), This means each event is effecting the events after it so the events are not independant of eachother, so the total number of insertons and deletions is _not_ poisson distributed.
